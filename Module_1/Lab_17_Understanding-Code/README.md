# Lab | Understanding others code

## Description
Yesterday we spoke about your first week's project. Today we ask you to take someone else's code, understand it and improve it. 

## Goals
This is important because you:
* You learn how to read and understand the code.
* Learn from others by reading their projects.
  * New methods.
  * New ways of thinking.
  * Best practices.
* Your partner learns from you thanks to your feedback.
  * He/she knows his/her strenghts.
  * He/she learns some ways to improve.

## Instructions
* Look for the repository of the partner you have been assigned to (TA will share in the Slack channel).
* First, understand the workflow he/she built in their improved version of their code.
* Draw / write the workflow for yourself and note your doubts about it.
* Look for things he/she made that you think could be useful for you.
* What should be improved?
* Fork the code
* Make the improvements
* Commit the improvements
* Comment your improvements
