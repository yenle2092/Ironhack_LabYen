**7. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 5. Give some insights.**

**8. Take a look at the data you retrieved in question 6. Give some insights.**

**9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?**

**10. How could you take the top 3 regarding both user ratings and number of votes?**

**11. Do people care about the price of an app?** Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?
