# Lab | MySQL Select

## Introduction

 In this lab, we will practice selecting and projecting data. You can finish all questions with only these clauses:
- `SELECT`
- `SELECT DISTINCT`
- `COUNT`
- `FROM`
- `WHERE`
- `ORDER BY`
- `GROUP BY`
- `SUM`
- `LIMIT`

The Sql script is here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tT1OTdIgkI5tkeeXIsnZwMC5SxI1FE9m/view
Please submit your solutions in a text file `solutions.sql`.
